 *
 * Field Number:
 *  1. Number of devices with unique IDs currently received regardless of the horizontal or vertical separation. 0-99
 *  2. Transmission status:
 *      1 for OK
 *      0 for no transmission.
 *  3. GPS status:
 *      0 = no GPS reception
 *      1 = 3d-fix on ground, i.e. not airborne
 *      2 = 3d-fix when airborne
 *  4. Power status:
 *      1 for OK
 *      0 for under- or over-voltage.
 *  5. Alarm level as assessed by FLARM:
 *      0 = no alarm (also used for no-alarm traffic information)
 *      1 = aircraft or obstacle alarm, 15-20 seconds to impact, Alert Zone alarm, or traffic advisory (<AlarmType> = 4)
 *      2 = aircraft or obstacle alarm, 10-15 seconds to impact
 *      3 = aircraft or obstacle alarm, 0-10 seconds to impact
 *  6. Relative bearing in degrees from true ground track to the intruder’s position. -180 - 180
 *  7.  Type of alarm as assessed by FLARM:
 *      0 = no aircraft within range or no-alarm traffic information
 *      2 = aircraft alarm
 *      3 = obstacle/Alert Zone alarm (if data port version < 7, otherwise only obstacle alarms are indicated by <AlarmType> = 3)
 *      4 = traffic advisory (sent once each time an aircraft enters within distance 1.5 km and vertical distance 300 m from own ship; when data port version >=4)
 *  8. Relative vertical separation in meters above own position. -32768 to 32767
 *  9. Relative horizontal distance in meters to the target or obstacle. 0 to 2147483647
 *  10. 6-digit hexadecimal value (e.g. “5A77B1”) as configured in the target’s PFLAC,,ID.
